# Welcome to My Hodgepodge Stew

A blend of topics I'm passionate about:

- **Robotics** – How machines sense, plan, and move.  
- **Autonomous Driving** – Perception, fusion, and intelligent control.  
- **Deep Learning & Foundation Models** – Modern AI, from transformers to multimodal systems.  
- **Computing Units** – Hardware and systems behind intelligent tech.
